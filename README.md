# Kosha Redis Connector

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that you can use as a high-performance caching and storage solution so that your applications can quickly and efficiently retrieve data.

The Kosha Redis connector enables you to perform REST API operations from the Redis API in your Kosha workflow or custom application. Using the Redis connector, you can directly access the Redis platform to:

* Add members to a hash key
* Set the value for a key
* Ping the Redis server

## Useful Actions

You can use the Kosha Redis connector to manage hashes, key/value pairs, lists, and sets.

Refer to the Kosha Redis connector [API specification](openapi.json) for details.

### Hashes

Use the hash API to add or remove members from a hash key.

### Key/Value Pairs

Use the k/v API to set values for keys or to remove keys.

### Lists

Use the list API to add or remove members from a list.

### Sets

Use the set API to add or remove members from a set.

## Authentication

To authenticate when provisioning the Kosha Redis connector, you need your:

* Redis server username
* Redis server host
* Redis server port
* Redis DB name
* Redis DB password
